\begin{abstract}
To address a lack of attention to the welfare effects of house price returns generated by public policies that enhance environmental quality, I develop a dynamic model for a hedonic housing asset traded in a competitive market. The model distinguishes between the firm that owns each house and the consumers who rent. I derive present-value welfare change measures for non-marginal and marginal changes in amenities that are consistent with the static measures currently available. The dynamic welfare measures provide additional details about the distribution of benefits over time that reveal the inherent pecuniary externalities in hedonic asset markets that result in a transfer of economic benefits of amenity improvements from renter to owner. I also develop and consider a model extension specific to owner-occupied housing, and briefly discuss the policy implications of these results in the contexts of benefit cost analysis and environmental justice.

\section{Introduction}

\caps{Economic assessments of} ecosystem service values frequently focus on quantifying direct economic benefits to households or consumers. The consumer oriented approach often follows from the way ecosystem services directly affect human well-being. However, in addition to direct impacts on human well-being, there are often price changes that accompany changes in ecosystem service flows. This is particularly evident with the hedonic price method, which uses changes in market prices to assess the benefits associated with improvements in environmental amenities that benefit households. 

The hedonic price method was grounded in the context of partial equilibrium of competitive markets by Rosen (1974). For much of the history of the method, identification of economic benefits required estimating a second stage demand function or making additional assumptions about the stability of the hedonic function across non-marginal variations in amenities (Freeman et al. 2014). 

The relative price changes that accompany economic activity have been described as pecuniary external economies (Scitovsky 1954, Buchanan and Stubblebine 1962). Pecuniary externalities that arise due to market activity are not considered economically inefficient and do not contribute to deadweight loss. However, pecuniary externalities do affect well-being and when they arise as a consequence of public decision making, it is not appropriate to ignore the costs and benefits that spillover into related markets . 

The hedonic price method of assessing the private benefits of ecosystem services to the occupants of housing is an apt example of a methodology that typically omits pecuniary effects from consideration. As discussed below, the hedonic price method relies on indirect changes in housing prices to quantify the economic values that occupants place on environmental amenities. The fact that the unit of housing as a productive asset has increased in value due to the improved amenities is generally ignored in the environmental economics literature. 

In contrast to much of the environmental economics literature, other fields that consider changes in housing prices focus on price changes as they relate to the value of housing as an asset.  

and those price changes can be used to . These price changes are pecuniary externalities and part of the way efficient markets function and benefits or costs that come about as a consequence of them are known as pecuniary externalities. 



The consumer oriented approach is sensible because individual well-being is the fundamental concern of economics. Economic models allow for evidence of changes in consumption to be used to measure changes in well-being. and information about consumption opportunities obtained through  active and passive use of ecosystem services. Many questions about ecosystem services focus on services that are public goods (non-excludable and non-rival) or club goods (non-excludable and rival). This makes sense in the context of public decision making and regulation because even well-functioning private markets are not expected to provide efficient levels of public and club goods.  

However, understanding how people benefit from ecosystem services through the consumption of private goods (excludable and rival)  also receives attention. Access to private real estate is a prime example of a private good that may be necessary for enjoying certain excludable ecosystem services. Hedonic valuation studies are generally recognized as a means for quantifying the economic benefits of these excludable ecosystem service values. 

People can benefit from housing in two distinct ways: as the owner and as the renter. This distinction is embodied in the treatment of housing in national income accounting.  National Income Accounts include new houses in the Private Fixed Investment category along with new factories, in the Rental Income of Persons category as well as in the Personal Consumption Expenditure category with food and recreation https://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/nipa-handbook. These categorized measures of aggregate trade flows from housing provide a framework for using the hedonic price method for quantifying economic benefits related to housing. 

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Benefits of Amenities}

Freeman and more recently Freeman et al. are commonly cited as a source for theoretical underpinnings of the data and models used for estimating the benefits to housing consumers.  

Freeman (1979) describes the process of aggregating the benefits to households of marginal improvements in amenities as a process of summing welfare measures based on analysis of household demand. Freeman (1999) asks, “how can we use the information on prices and preferences that can be extracted from the hedonic housing market to calculate  measures of welfare change for changes in environmental amenities?” 



Smith and Huang (1995) conducted an early meta-analysis of hedonic studies relating to air quality and considered only MWTP as a source of benefits. They also define MWTP as the “change in the asset value of the house”. 

Zabel and Kiel (2000) discuss measuring the benefits to homeowners and their households” and focus exclusively on quantifying benefits related to consumer demand, as evidenced by their discussion of the indirect utility function when aggregating economic benefits for the purpose of benefit cost anaylsis. In their concluding remarks, Zabel and Kiel (2000) compare their results to Smith and Huang’s (1995) results while describing them as benefits to the home owners. 

Bui and Mayer (2003) quantify environmental amenity benefits by assessing their capitalization into housing prices. Bishop and Murphy (2011,2019) estimate dynamic models that include expectations about future prices 



\subsection{External Economies} 

In Economics, pecuniary and technological externalities have been defined to characterize interactions among market as well as political participants (Holcombe and Sobel 2001). Scitovsky (1954) discussed external economies in the context of industrial organization, distinguishing between technological and pecuniary externalities. Buchanan and Stubblebine (1962) generalized technological externalities to include consumers. Technological externalities have a directly impact on an external party other than through prices while the many effects of price changes are pecuniary externalities. Holcombe and Sobel (2001) suggest that because pecuniary externalities do not result in economic inefficiency the associated losses and gains have received much less attention. The direct mentions of pecuniary externalities in recent literature (e.g., Dávila and Korinek 2018) are largely confined to macroeconomic discussions related to investment and finance. 

Externalities are also referred to as spillovers. Kelly (2011) discuss strategic spillovers where externalities are generated deliberately as a form of “extortion”. 

Investigations of pecuniary externalities in environmental economics often focus on indirect effects. The debate over the indirect effects of biofuel subsidies provides a template for considering some of the ways relative price changes may be included in policy design. Zilberman et al. (2011) examine the impact of biofuel subsidies on indirect land use change through increased food prices, and they begin by noting the validity of considering pecuniary externalities in policy design. In Zilberman et al (2011) and other studies such as Zilberman et al. (2013) a similar group of authors cast doubt on the inclusion of indirect land use change in biofuel subsidy planning largely because of the myriad other indirect effects that add to uncertainty and which should also be included, in an ideal world. 





\subsection{Environmental Justice} 

Improved environmental quality can lead to gentrification, displacing lower income households that tend to rent rather than own their homes (Banzhaf et al 2019). 	 





\section{Methods}
A firm purchases a house at time $t$ for $P_t$ borrowed at interest rate $r$. Later, at $t+1$, the firm sells the
house for $P_t+1$ and repays the loan plus interest, (1 + 𝑟)𝑃𝑡
. After purchasing the house, the firm rents
out the unit of housing for, 𝑅𝑡 and pays costs 𝐶𝑡
